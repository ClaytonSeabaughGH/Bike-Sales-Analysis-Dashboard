# Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bike sales data to derive actionable insights and visualize trends. The analysis was conducted using SQL (MySQL) to clean, transform, and analyze the dataset, followed by the creation of a dashboard to present key findings.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Data Cleaning**: Utilized SQL to clean and prepare data from 2,361 companies for analysis. Applied a 4-step cleaning process:
  1. Removed duplicates.
  2. Standardized data formats.
  3. Reviewed and addressed null and blank values.
  4. Eliminated unnecessary rows and columns.
  
- **Data Transformation**: Leveraged SQL techniques such as **JOINS** and **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to filter and transform raw data into a usable format.

- **Data Analysis**: Applied **CTEs**, **RANK()**, and **aggregate functions** to identify trends and insights. Specifically, analyzed the top 5 companies with the most layoffs, segmented by year.

- **Dashboard Creation**: Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and insights derived from the analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (MySQL)**: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: For creating the interactive dashboard (specify the tool used, e.g., Tableau, Power BI, or Excel).

## Repository Structure
- **SQL Scripts**: Contains the SQL queries used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Data**: Includes the dataset(s) used for the analysis.
- **Dashboard**: Files or screenshots of the final dashboard (if applicable).

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `SQL Scripts` folder to review the SQL queries used for data cleaning and analysis.
3. Explore the `Data` folder to access the dataset(s).
4. Check the `Dashboard` folder for visualizations or instructions on how to view the final dashboard.

## Insights
- Identified the top 5 companies with the highest layoffs, categorized by year.
- Discovered trends in layoffs over time, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset to include additional years or industries for broader analysis.
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict future layoff trends.
- Enhance the dashboard with additional interactive features.
